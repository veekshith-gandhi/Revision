ARRAY:

1. An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
2. Array elements store in a contiguous memory location.
3. Array works with a static memory. Here static memory means that the memory size is fixed and cannot 
   be changed at the run time.
4. Array elements are independent of each other.
5. Array takes more time while performing any operation like insertion, deletion, etc.
6. Accessing any element in an array is faster as the element in an array can be directly accessed through the index.
7. In the case of an array, memory is allocated at compile-time.

LINKEDLIST :

1. A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts, i.e., data and address.
2. Linked list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.
3. The Linked list works with dynamic memory. Here, dynamic memory means that the memory size can be 
   changed at the run time according to our requirements.
4. Linked list elements are dependent on each other. As each node contains the address of the next node so to access the next node,
   we need to access its previous node.
5. Linked list takes less time while performing any operation like insertion, deletion, etc.
6. Accessing an element in a linked list is slower as it starts traversing from the first element of the linked list.
7. In the case of a linked list, memory is allocated at run time.
